For example, given a model trained on the MNIST digits, it's difficult to fully explore the latent space for a given digit.\n","\n","We can solve this by conditioning $P$ by not only the latent vector $z$, but some value $c$ that can encode information, (_e.g._: which MNIST digit we're generating).\n","\n","This would mean our decoder would got from $P(X|z)$ in the VAE case to $P(X|z,c)$ in the CVAE case.\n","\n","### Practical Implementation\n","\n","Practically, this means that a \"conditional\" vector $c$ is passed to the decoder.
